// Champion : Fiora "The Duelst"

//Attributes            Behaviors

// 1) Lunge             Fiora dashes a short distance in the target direction, then stabs a nearby enemy if one is  present, moving into attack range of them. Stabbing an enemy reduces Lunge's cooldown by 60%.

// 2) Riposte            Block all incoming damage


// 3) Bladework         The first basic attack can never critically strike, but slows its target by 30% for 1 second,                   while the second basic attack is guaranteed tocritically strike for bonus critical damage.


// 4) Grand Challenge    Fiora challenges the target enemy champion for 8 seconds, highlighting their four Vitals


// 5) Duelist's Dance   identifies the Vitals of nearby enemy champions, marked as an arc around themselves.
